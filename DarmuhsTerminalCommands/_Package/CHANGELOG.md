# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
 
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).
This project does NOT adhere to perfect Semantic Versioning. Mostly because I don't have the time to learn how to use it.

## [3.5.0]
 - Completely reworked terminal cams logic.
	- Adding one less image object for better optimization.
	- Disabling all cams-type commands will leave (or re-enable) the vanilla "view monitor" command
	- overall lots of optimizations with this.
 - Reworked custom background Terminal Customization.
	- Will now completely fill the screen space at all times
	- No longer covers the cams feeds from any of the cams-type commands
 - Added return to last node handling.
	- The terminal will now return to the last node you were viewing when you start using it.
	- It will also save any un-submitted text for you.
	- If another terminal user updates the terminal screen to another node your last cached node will update with it.
 - Added new config item [TerminalFillEmptyText] which allows you to add a base level of formatting from a few options for any terminalnode with text that does not fill the screen.
	- default value is nochange and will do nothing.
 - Added patch to fix zeekers typo in TextPostProcess()
 - Updated radar zoom command to allow for input. You should now be able to perform a command such as "zoom 30" to set the zoom to 30
	- this probably wont work with a multiword keyword like "radar zoom 10", I may add a fix for this later
 - Added some more compatibility stuff for suitsTerminal.
 - Added new config item [aodOffDelay] to determine seconds delay after a player is detected off the ship where it will turn off the screen
	- If a player returns to the ship within this time the screen will not turn off

## [3.4.1]
 - Updated base custom font path to look for folders in the Bepinex/Config folder.
	- This is because custom content packs cannot make folders in the base Bepinex folder.
	- See [Minecraft TerminalFont](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/darmuh/Minecraft_TerminalFont/) as an example for proper folder structure for a font pack.
 - Fixed issue with Terminal Resolution bonus calculator throwing errors due to bad math.
	- Thanks to nickham13 for the report and sorry for the mistake :)
 - Fixed minor visual bug with alwaysonatstart showing the incorrect credits amount until the terminal was used

## [3.4.0]
 - Updated to OpenLib v0.1.6
 - Added License file to package
 - Adjusted conflict resolution feature for better matching.
	- Will now prioritize matching that start the same as your input with a bonus score system.
	- This will fix issues like typing "ass" and getting lasso instead of assurance.
 - Fixed issue with dropship syncing (as part of the refund feature) where clients would get an extra item from their order.
	- Thank you for the report nickham13!
 - Fixed unreported issue with refund command that would let a client get more credits than the cost of the items they originally purchased.
	- This was related to the above bugfix for dropship syncing.
 - Added new Terminal Customization features:
	- You can now change the terminal font to a font specified in the [CustomFontName] config item.
	- There are 3 different ways of getting the specified font:
		- system font on your OS
		- custom fonts you've installed on your system (which go to "%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Fonts")
		- specify a folder within the bepinex root folder space that contains font files via the [CustomFontPath] config item.
	- You can also change the font **size** for the main text, the money text at the top left, and the terminalClock text if it's enabled.
	- HUGE thank you to DiFFoZ for pointing me in the right direction for this feature and helping me debug when I ran into issues.
 - Now using OpenLib SoftCompatibility checker for soft dependencies.
 - Potentially fixed issue with AlwaysOnDynamic (untested)

## [3.3.7]
 - Fixed conflict resolution trying to return keywords with less than 3 characters.
	- another mod was adding a blank keyword (likely for an enemy bestiary registry) that was causing the terminal to resolve most shorthand input to this keyword.

## [3.3.6]
 - Fixed issue with conflict resolution trying to add the same terminalKeyword causing keyword matching to break
	- Thanks mina for the report and steps to reproduce!
 - Added more visible logging statements to players by default.
 - Added more null reference handling with better log messaging explaining what is happening
	- Attempting to load home page now if a node is detected null when starting to use the terminal

## [3.3.5]
 - Updated mod to use OpenLib version 0.1.5
	- Offloaded more game patches to OpenLib events
 - Updated incorrect config option descriptions
 - Fixed TerminalHistory issue of not creating the history keybind shortcuts
	- Thanks to pacoito for the report!
 - Improved TerminalConflictResolution keyword handling
	- Thanks again to pacoito for the reported issues!

## [3.3.4]
 - Updated mod to use OpenLib version 0.1.4
	- This should fix the issue of the NetworkingCheck failing, causing vanilla compatibility to fail.
 - Added configuration item - terminalShortcutCommands to allow for disabling the bind/unbind keywords while keeping shortcut functionality.
	- You will only be able to modify shortcuts via the configuration item, and they will only refresh between lobby loads.
 - Fixed issue where bind/unbind was getting created regardless of whether or not the terminalShortcuts feature was enabled.

## [3.3.3]
 - Fixed Manifest to target correct version of OpenLib

## [3.3.2]
 ### Fixed/Changed
 - Fixed newly introduced issue for TerminalHistory in version 3.3.0 which caused the feature to not work at all.
	- Commands were not being added to the command history list so the keybinds were not doing anything in particular.
 - Fixed issue where, with certain config files, the category menus would not update their displayText properly.
	- This issue was resolved by updating OpenLib to 0.1.3

## [3.3.1]
 ### Fixed/Changed
 - Fixed critical error that would brick the terminal with the TerminalHistory configuration item enabled.
	- Apologies for the inconvenience and thankyou to all in the modding discord who helped troubleshoot
 - Adjust more menu category to not display a category if no commands exist for it.

## [3.3.0]
 ### Added
 - More Customization!
	- Added configuration options for:
		- Money background color/alpha
		- A new custom screen background, color/alpha
		- Terminal Buttons Color
		- Terminal Keyboard Color
 - New Quality of Life Feature, Conflict Resolution
	- Similar to TerminalConflictFix, will use string comparison to provide the best matching keyword
	- Uses the Fastenshtein implementation of the Levenshtein algorithm for fast/efficient string comparison.
 - Added More command information to "other" command output.
 - Added customization refresh command to the terminal. Run this command after you modify any of the customization settings in your config.
 - Added radarZoom command to change the zoom level of the terminal radar.
	- Built-in compatibility with tworadarmaps
	- currently rotates through a range of possible zoom levels, each time you run the command.
	- may add further configurables to this in the future.
	- zoom levels will be synced with the rest of the lobby if networkedNodes is enabled.
		- Without tworadarmaps this WILL affect the mapscreen in the terminal.
 - Also added [TerminalRadarDefaultZoom] as a quality of life config setting to change the default radarzoom.
	- This will be synced at each client load-in if networkedNodes are enabled.
	- While the radarZoom command is recommended to be used alongside this feature, it is not required.
	

 ### Fixed/Changed
 - Command creation/deletion system has been offloaded to my new library "OpenLib"
	- This will allow my other mods to quickly utilize the same system without the need for continuous porting.
	- OpenLib will be open to anyone to utilize/contribute to. My only request is that it continues to support my own mods.
	- OpenLib adds new backend features such as
		- Config watching with the ManagedConfig class.
			- Allows for easily checking networking required config items, checking for features being disabled/enabled between lobbies, and associating separate config items to eachother.
		- Event system which allows my mods to not require patching into the game.
			- The library will do the patching and create events for my mods to subscribe to.
		- Extensive Terminal Keyword/Node/Store/etc. system.
			- Will ensure no conflicting keywords exist, utilize similar terminalNodes whenever possible, and clear any items added utilizing this library on lobby close.
	- While I have extensively tested the move to OpenLib, there may be some new bugs introduced with this move. If you experience any issues please let me know.
 - Fixed issue with return to cams that would throw null errors and break the terminal if only certain cams types were enabled.
	- Thank you to mmiinnaa11 on discord for the report and assistance in troubleshooting.
 - Fixed issue of throwing LogError messages when the message was more suited to be a warning or below level log message.
 - Fixed issue of not syncing cams views between players with TwoRadarMaps present.
	- while this added a networking method for switch/previous, this new method will only run when networkedNodes are enabled.
 - Fixed issue of previous not being able to cycle to the end of the player list with TwoRadarMaps present
 - Adjusted binding logic for TerminalHistory/TerminalAutocomplete binds to not throw a log error message at each load-in
 - Cleaned TerminalClock creation method up a bit
 - Adjusted restart command to sync between players. This feature will now require networking.
 - Fixed issue with StorePacks returning a null node if you could not afford them and use any keyword besides deny/confirm

## [3.2.5]
 ### Added
 - New Quality of Life feature which will keep the terminalLight on whenever the screen is on.
	- This has been added as an option for the [TerminalLightBehaviour] configuration option.
	- set [TerminalLightBehaviour] to alwayson to try this new feature!
 - Added customization items for the following:
	- [TerminalScrollbarColor] change the color of the scrollbar
	- [TerminalScrollBGColor] change the color of the background portion of the scrollbar
	- [TerminalClockColor] change the color of the clock text item that is added via [terminalClock]
	- [TerminalLightColor] change the color of the Terminal Light

 ### Fixed/Changed
 - Moved [terminalClock] to Quality of Life section and updated description.
 - Fixed recently introduced issue where alwaysondynamic was not actually disabling the terminal screen when leaving the ship if you had [alwaysOnWhileDead] disabled

	
## [3.2.4]
 ### Fixed/Changed
 - Recompiled for compatibility with v55.
 - Moved more configuration options around. Sections have been condensed.
 - Updated config option name [enemyScanCost] to [bioScanScanCost] for clarity as to what this is

## [3.2.3]
 ### Added
 - Added new Quality of Life features
	- [TerminalHistory], will store up to [TerminalHistoryMaxCount] commands that can be accessed with the up/down arrows.
		- Requires [terminalShortcuts] to function.
		- [TerminalHistoryMaxCount] is the max amount of historical commands remembered by the terminal.
	- [TerminalAutoComplete], will allow you to auto-complete to a matching keyword in the terminal by pressing [TerminalAutoCompleteKey]
		- Requires [terminalShortcuts] to function.
		- If more than one command matches the input, you can press tab to cycle through all matching commands
		- If [TerminalAutoCompleteKey] is set to Tab, will disable the Tab key quitting the terminal and update the HUD hint.
		- [TerminalAutoCompleteMaxCount] is the max amount of matching commands that autocomplete will cycle through
			- if more commands match than this number, auto-complete will not change your input to any other command.
 ### Fixed/Changed
 - Moved some config options around.
 - Updated key detection press delays to be more in-line with the new suitsTerminal defaults

## [3.2.2]
 ### Added
 - Added support for LobbyCompatibility mod.
	- Will set flags on load-in based on whether network is enabled or disabled.
		- These flags do not refresh if the networking config item is changed after loading.
 - New Section "Quality of Life"
	- This section will have simple client-side changes to the terminal.
	- Currently the two new configuration items for this section are [LockCameraInTerminal] and [DisableTerminalLight]
 - New Section "Terminal Customization"
	- This section will have client-side customization of the Terminal.
	- [TerminalCustomization] will enable or disable this entire section of customizations.
	- [TerminalColor] changes the color of the actual physical Terminal Object.
	- [TerminalTextColor] changes the color of the main text in the terminal.
	- [TerminalMoneyColor] changes the color of the current credits text in the top left of the terminal
	- [TerminalCaretColor] changes the color of the text caret in the terminal
	- Currently, the defaults are set as examples of some fun colors to change things to.
	- Host and client can have different customization settings depending on config settings.

 ### Fixed/Changed
 - Updated project to utilize plugin version number wherever possible, including compiling the assembly with the version number.
	- Now when I update the version number in one spot, it'll update it everywhere (except the changelog, keeping that manual)

## [3.2.1]
 ### Fixed
 - Clients were having their commands deleted when joining. This made the mod basically un-usable for any clients.
	- Fixed this by moving the command deletion method so that commands are only deleted when you leave a game, not when you are first loading in.
	- Thank you to @_rafael_barreto_ for the report on the discord thread for this mod.

## [3.2.0] 
 ### Added
 - Added new feature called Purchase Packs (enabled via the [terminalPurchasePacks] configuration item)
	- With this you can add customized purchase packs to the store.
	- Purchase packs and their keywords are set in the [purchasePackCommands] configuration item.
	- Syntax for this configuration item is "command:item1,item2,etc.;next command:item1,item2"
		- The ":" separates the command from the items being purchased.
		- Each item is separated by a "," just type what you would type in the terminal to buy it (ie. shov for shovel)
		- Ship Upgrades can also be added to purchase packs, like my example "PortalPack"
			- These are matched differently from standard items and will match to an upgrade that starts the same
			- so in my example "inverse" matches with "inverse teleporter" and "teleporter" matches with "teleporter"
		- Then each purchase pack is separated by a ";"
		- Failure to adhere to this syntax can result in errors
	- If you list more than 12 items in one purchase pack, the terminal will tell you the dropship can only hold 12 items.
		- From my own testing, I've been able to get 24 items from a dropship, however I do suggest keeping this warning in mind.
 - Added new configuration option [developerLogging] for my more spammy log messages.
	- This is a retroactive change following the development of the purchase packs feature having a LOT of logs.
	- If you find any log messages that show in extensiveLogging that should probably be in developerLogging please let me know :)
 - Added configurable keywords for the [terminalLobby] command to avoid conflicts with the LobbyControl mod by mattymatty
	- This will be set via the [lobbyKeywords] configuration option
 - Added the ability to configure the resolution for both potential cameras created with OpenBodyCams via this mod
	- see [obcResolutionMirror] and [obcResolutionBodyCam]
 - Added soft dependency for TerminalFormatter to detect if this mod is present and avoid double adding stuff to the store

 ### Fixed/Changed
 - Added some more null reference handling, especially when handling configuration items that can have incorrect format
 - Added "SpawnPlayerAnimation" patch for AlwaysOnDynamic coroutine rather than attempting to run it every time the ship is landed.
	- This may resolve some issues of the monitor not being on for someone who died on the last moon.
 - Fixed error being thrown when buying something quickly and this mod is paired with TerminalFormatter
 - Fixed Route Random being able to send you into debt with negative credits
	- Now if you dont have enough credits you will be told lol
 - Changed store names for VitalsPatch and BioscanPatch as they were much too long.
	- I may make this configurable in the future but for now they are the above names in the store.
 - Fixed some issues with the cameras created via OpenBodyCams for this mod.
	- This was practically a complete rework of how OpenBodyCams is utilized in this mod.
	- Added a function to remove persisting cameras between lobbys.
 - Fixed some issues with the home-brew cameras created with this mod.
 - Adjusted refund command to be more accurate, including trying to get current sales price for each item.
 - Fixed issue with StoreRotation that caused anything I added to the store to break the store with this mod enabled.
 - Fixed visual bug with Vitals Upgrade displaying wrong credits after performing the upgrade (the correct credits amount was being deducted still)
 - Updated configuration items for more consistency/clarity
	- extensiveLogging has been moved to "__Debug" section
	- Moved alwayson config options [alwaysOnAtStart], [alwaysOnDynamic], and [alwaysOnWhileDead] to new section "Always On"
	- updated [canOpenDoorInSpace] description to explain that this setting does not change actual game logic for the door in space
	- Clamped [routeRandomCost] so that you can't set it to a negative value and give yourself credits...
 - Added the rest of the home page as configuration options to allow full configuration of the home page.
	- The new configuration option is [homeHelpLines]
 - Changed some core functions in how this mod adds command to the terminal.
	- This mod will now delete any pre-existing keywords/nodes if you have closed and opened another lobby.
		- This will now make it possible to enable/disable commands between sessions without having to close the game to remove a command's functionality.
		- This will also fix an issue I noticed where multiple keywords/nodes for the same command were being created due to hosting a new lobby.
	- For multiple keywords, I am now reusing the same node rather than making a node for each keyword.
	- While I don't expect a performance difference from this optimization, it was bothering me once I noticed the issue which delayed this update a bit.


## [3.1.0]
 ### Added
 - Mod is now completely self-reliant, with only soft dependencies if you so choose to enable certain features (fovAdjust, OpenBodyCams, etc.)
	- This mod no longer uses TerminalAPI to create/implement commands. I have created my own home-brew command adding logic which I first used with ghostCodes' terminal commands.
	- This was also a decision I made to give myself more freedom in what kind of commands I can create with this mod; including adding items to the vanilla store.
	- My own command creation logic is HEAVILY influenced by TerminalAPI, so I still would like to give Atomic a huge thank you for their wonderful API.
	- If for whatever reason you experience issues with this version of the mod failing to create commands consistently, I suggest returning to version 3.0.4 which still relies on TerminalAPI.
	- Confirmation logic has also been reworked and built into the base-game terminal confirmation logic, rather than being it's own separate system.
	- This mod's command help menu (more) has also been built in as regular terminal commands.
 - You can now have as many keywords as you want for each command! (well, most of them)
	- In the default configuration for each keyword you will see examples of multiple keywords for each command.
	- Format is "keyword1; keyword two; anotherkeyword; etc"
	- I have not set a hard limit on keywords per command, however use caution when adding so many words for one action.
	- At the moment, this will also attempt to delete any other duplicate keywords. So I'd avoid making any keywords such as "store" for example.
	- For certain commands, this feature has not been implemented yet. This may change in a future update.
	- If you find any issues with this new feature please reach out on the modding discord or my github
 - Added better syncing of the terminal between players when networked terminal nodes is enabled
	- You should now have completely synced cams between players on the terminal when always-on is enabled.
	- Cams will even sync when joining another lobby where the host has enabled a cam on the terminal already.
	- The video player can also be synced if you choose, with the [videoSync] config option.
 - Improved Always On Display handling
	- Added better handling for Always On Dynamic, may see slight performance increase.
	- Adding config item to keep monitors on after death [alwaysOnWhileDead]
 - Improved Terminal Clock feature, will now display on terminal when screen is on (additional compatibility with alwayson feature introduced)
	- Improved handling of terminal 
	- feature, may see slight performance increase.
 - Improved home-brew camera creation/handling
	- Home-brew camera mask should now be up to standards with most other mods that use cameras. Thanks again to Zaggy for all the pointers.
	- Targeting system for both mirror/bodycams has been improved as well.
 - Improved teleport command handling
	- Removed check every store purchase in favor of detecting the specific teleporter instance.
 - Added teleport by name feature per request.
	- This is built on-top of the terminalTP configuration option and does not currently have it's own configuration option.
	- simply type your teleport keyword, such as "tp", followed by the player's name.
		- if a player matches the name listed, they will be teleported.
		- if no matching player is found, the command falls back to just pressing the tp button.
 - Added Route Random command per request. [terminalRouteRandom]
	- This command is part of the "fun" section
	- For your configuration fun, this command can choose from all moons or filter out moons with specific weather types via [routeRandomBannedWeather]
		- Valid weather options: None, DustClouds, Rainy, Stormy, Foggy, Flooded, Eclipsed
		- Separate each weather option by a semi-colon in the same way you would do the multiple keywords option
		- Default config is filtering out flooded, eclipsed, and foggy weather from potential routing options
	- To prevent command "abuse" where someone would keep rolling random till they got a high value moon I have added a flat rate price via [routeRandomCost]
		- You can configure this to 0 if you want this command to be free, the default is set to 100 credits.
		- You will be charged this amount of credits no matter what moon you get, even free ones.
	- Another idea I've had regarding this command, but not implemented, is making this command a one time use that refreshes every time you land.
		- If there is interest in this option, I can add a config option for this later.
 - Added networking check on mod startup. Checks if ModNetworking configuration is set to disabled (indicating this mod should work with vanilla clients)
	- Any other config items that requires networking will automatically be disabled to ensure compatibility with vanilla clients.

 ### Fixed/Changed
 - Terminal Upgrades such as bioscanpatch and vitalspatch are now properly integrated into the store.
 - Upgrades should also be synced between all players now, rather than per player individually.
 - Optimized code handling, might see slightly improved performance in longer sessions pertaining to this mod specifically.
 - Lol command has been renamed to Video for better clarity.
	- This includes any config option that referenced "lol" such as terminaLol will now say "video" ie. terminalVideo
	- It remains in the Fun section of commands
 - Updated compatibility with OpenBodyCams' latest update.
	- Resolution is now set to 1000x700 by default. Expect a configuration option for this in the future.
	- Mirror now properly utilizes OpenBodyCams to create a camera when it is detected (and with camsUseDetectedMods enabled)
	- Improved overall handling for this mods' OpenBodyCams cameras.
 - Improved Cams hiding logic for better consistency
	- Have updated the list of commands that will not hide cams views after being run
 - Reorganized Code into sectional folders for my own sanity...

	
## [3.0.4]

 ### Fixed
 - Added bioscanpatch config option to disable the patch but not bioscan itself.
	- Fixed bioscanpatch always being enabled.
 - Added compatibility for latest update of suitsTerminal
 - Added fix for this mod's commands that was found while working on suitsTerminal.
 - Added culling mask fix for mirror command that was found during suitsTerminal development.

## [3.0.3]

 ### Fixed
 - Fixed an issue when using OpenBodyCams to create a camera and having AlwaysOn disabled, the camera would freeze after exiting the terminal.
	- Camera should now be properly disabled when leaving the terminal.
	- Added extensiveLogging statements to show when the camera is disabled or enabled.

 ### Note
 - Since this update took so long I'm probably forgetting some things that have been changed/fixed/updated.
 - If you have any questions regarding this update feel free to post on github, discord, etc. I may not see it right away but I will answer once I have the time.

 <details open>
 <summary>Historical Patch Notes</summary>

## [3.0.2]

 ### Added
 - Added support for multiword terminal shortcuts.
	- Multiword shortcuts will be stored regardless of whether they are valid commands or not.
	- Proper usage is: bind <key> <multiple word command>
	- Handling for multi-word shortcuts differs from single-word shortcuts.
 - Added terminal shortcuts commands to controls commands menu.

 ### Fixed
 - (hopefully) Fixed issue where pressing switch button on ship monitors without any active monitoring mode would cause odd visual bugs of seeing other player's POVs instead of your own.
 - Fixed minor compatibility issue with monitoring commands and only having the TwoRadarMaps mod on where the cams views would not update to the right target.
 - Removed *most* references to AdvancedCompany due to it being removed from Thunderstore. Compatibility functions will be added back if it does ever make it back to thunderstore.


## [3.0.1]

 ### Fixed
 - Fixed issue with menus where next page would get stuck after using any of the view commands (cams/map/minicams/minimap/overlay)
 - Fixed compatibility integration issues with OpenBodyCams
 - Fixed certain patching issues that would break the terminal. This was caused by some other mods for some people and shouldn't occur anymore.

## [3.0.0]

 ### Added/Changed
 - COMPATIBILITY UPDATES FOR: LethalLevelLoader, OpenBodyCams, and TwoRadarMaps.
 - Mod has been **completely reworked** from the ground up. Command handling is now 100% integrated within TerminalAPI, with exception to a handful of dynamic input-based commands.
 - Networked Nodes received a substantial upgrade due to this rework and now much more reliably update for all clients.
 - Keyboard shortcut functionality has been added via terminalShortcuts configuration option!
 - Shortcuts can be set using the bind command and removed using the unbind command.
 - Shortcuts are saved in config under keyActionsConfig (dont touch this unless you know what you're doing).
 - Added the ability for this mod to produce it's own camera when no bodycams mods are present.
 - Added configuration option camsUseDetectedMods to utilize any known bodycam mod's camera when they are present.
 - Currently OpenBodyCams has the most integration built into this mod, however both SolosBodyCams and Helmet_Cameras by Rick Arg should also continue to work.
 - Big performance updates for Always-On mode and other continously running mod functions. Moved as much logic out of patches as possible, to improve compatibility with other mods.
 - Added configuration option alwaysOnDynamic that will turn the screen off when you are not on the ship.
 - Majority of logging statements have been moved to a separate function. You can see these messages by enabling the extensiveLogging config option.
 - New commands that can be enabled or disabled: terminalMirror, terminalRefund, terminalRestart, terminalPrevious
 - terminalMirror is a new mirror command that uses this mod's own camera (no external mod needed!)
 - terminalRefund allows for refunding items purhcased that have yet to be delivered.
 - terminalRestart will restart the lobby without triggering the firing sequence. Will ask for confirmation unless restartConfirmOverride is set to true.
 - Added further home page customization with homeTextArt. Use this configurable string to set your own ascii art.
 - Added tpKeyword and itpKeyword options to change the shorthand keywords.
 - All commands that affect credits now require networking. This is to make credit changes more consistent and prevent any future abuse.
 
 ### Fixed
 - Fixed issue with more command not hiding cams when it should.
 - Fixed compatibility issues with LethalLevelLoader by completely moving command handling off of custom terminal events
 - Fixed numerous compatibility issues with OpenBodyCams and TwoRadarMaps. Thanks Zaggy1024 for all the help!
 - Fixed issue where teleport keywords were still being deleted even with this section of the mod disabled.
 - Fixed issue where sometimes typing "extras" for the menu option would bring up buying an extension ladder.
 
## [2.2.4] **CURRENT VERSION**

 ### Added
 - Configuration option to start with Always On Enabled (alwaysOnAtStart)
 - Added Terminal Clock feature, this can be disabled via configuration option (terminalClock) and will be on by default (does not show in orbit)
 - Added clock toggle command to toggle the new Terminal Clock feature on/off (terminalClockCommand)
 - Added new feature to use the walkie-talkie item while at the terminal. This can be disabled via configuration option (walkieTerm)
 - walkieTerm feature comes with configuration binds for both a keyboard key (walkieTermKey) and a mousebutton (walkieTermMB)
 - walkieTerm keybindings will only do something while at the terminal with a walkie in your inventory

 - Added new List Items command which will display all non-scrap items that are not currently being held on the ship (terminalListItems)

## [2.2.3]

 ### Fixed
 - Cleaned up command adding logic to be more streamlined (this is more for me than anyone else lol)
 - Adding further null exception handling when dealing with spawning the nethandler (thanks Zuploader for reporting this on GitHub)
 - Fixed fcolor to also apply to non-pro flashlights
 - No real fix action here but, the previously determined incompatible Glowsticks mod actually just needs a specific [configuration setting](https://github.com/darmuh/TerminalStuff/issues/13) in LC_API.

 ### Added
 - Added secondary link command per request
 - Removed Fov_Adjust hard dependency (this mod will still be needed for the Fov command)
 - Added the ability to use hexcodes for both fcolor and scolor (ex: fcolor 19C3A7)
 - Added rainbow flashlight command "fcolor rainbow" (could affect performance, drop your flashlight to kill the rainbow effect)
 - Added configurable hint strings (displayed in extras) for the new link commands.

## [2.2.2]

 ### Fixed
 - Fixed map command only ever saying the ship was in orbit.


## [2.2.1]
 ### Added/Changed
 - (1) NETWORKING IS NOW TOGGLE-ABLE VIA ModNetworking CONFIG OPTION
 - (1) This means you can continue to use this mod as a client-side only mod as in the past.
 - (1) I've disabled a number of commands that require networking as well as commands I dont believe should be client-side only commands when networking is disabled.
 - (2) New randomsuits command to pick a random suit to wear off the rack (ported from my suitsTerminal mod, disable this if you have that)
 - (3) Made main page you open to when opening the terminal the home page rather than help.
 - (4) Added configurable strings to the home page, leave your crewmates a message to see every time they open the terminal!
 - (5) Added link command for linking to an external web page from the terminal.
 - (6) Added configurable keywords for fcolor, scolor, gamble, lever, link, and randomsuits commands.
 - (7) As with the command, added a configurable option for what link you want to display with the link command.
 
 ### Fixed

 - (2) Updated cams views to not hide cams whenever an invalid command is inputted (thanks to Sp1rit for the bug report on GitHub)
 - (3) Improved compatibility with Advanced Company & LateGame Upgrades.
 - (3) Specifically in how we all modify the help command of the terminal. It should now look much cleaner
 - (4) Fixed longstanding bug with FOV mod that would not adjust the visor with your FOV.

## [2.2.0] 
 ### Added/Changed
 - (1) NETWORKING HAS BEEN FIGURED OUT (sorta lol)
 - (1 cont.) Thanks to Evaisa for their UnityNetcodeWeaver NetcodePatcher tool and Xilophor for the very helpful wiki!
 - (2) Fcolor/Scolor commands should now sync between all clients
 - (3) Added 'networkedNodes' config option to try out the synced network nodes BETA feature
 - (3) (networkedNodes) clients will still have differing terminal instances and overall this mode mostly just tries to copy whatever the terminal user is seeing and display it on everyone else's terminal screen.
 - (3) (networkedNodes) I've labeled this as a BETA feature because i've done limited testing on it so it's bound to be buggy.
 - (4) Refactored code that has to do with switching cams pov and returning to camera screen after an event to be more modular.
 - (5) Overlay: Added configuration for Overlay Opacity. This will let you change how faded the map is on the cams view.

 ### Fixed
 - As mentioned above, flashlight colors and shiplight colors are no longer client-side only!
 - Fixed issue where switch command without a target player was overwriting switch command with a target player.
 - (hopefully) fixed an issue where switch command would bring up the wrong view.

## [2.1.1]
 ### Added/Changed
 - NEW Configuration option "camsNeverHide" to set cams views to not hide once another command is entered.
 - (camsNeverHide) if you want to be able to see the store list, help list, etc. and keep the cams view active you should set this to true.
 - (camsNeverHide) keeping this false (disabled) will hide cams views when any large text is entered but will keep them active for door codes, ping/flash radarbooster, and switch views commands.
 - I've also added a list of commands that will never hide the cams views despite either setting. I may make this configurable in the future. If interested please let me know.
 - Changed how cams/map display their views to use the same method as minimap/minicams/overlay. I can explain this in depth if anyone has questions.
 - Changed some excessive logging messages to hopefully clean up the log window a bit. There is still a lot of log messages but they are helpful when troubleshooting issues.
 - Changed when keywords get added. Shouldn't be noticeable to the average user.
 - TP/ITP: Added cooldown timer to text displayed when trying to run one of these commands while the TP itself is on cooldown.

 ### Fixed
 - Switch command should now work properly and not hide any cams/map views
 - Improved interopability with FastSwitchPlayerViewInRadar and removed a noticeable delay of their mod working only after a couple switch commands have been used.


## [2.1.0]
 ### Added/Changed
 - CHANGED CONFIG STRUCTURE AGAIN: Please delete your old config upon updating and let the mod generate a new one.
 - (Config) The update config now has which command belongs to which in-game category (if you type more).
 - CUSTOM KEYWORDS: Added a handful of configurable keywords. Take a look at the new config file to see what you can change!
 - lol: Reworked lol command to use the terminal's built in videoplayer and it will now display videos directly on the terminal!
 - scolor: added scolor command to change the color of the base lights in the ship.
 - (scolor) this command changes 3 separate light colors which are labeled "front", "middle", and "back"
 - (scolor) when using the command you specify what lights you want to change or simply type all for your selection.
 - (scolor) the third argument in this command is the color name. Like with fcolor you can see a list of these using "scolor list"
 - proview/minimap: changed keyword/name of the proview command to "minimap"
 - minicams: added inverse command of minimap where the cam is the small screen.
 - lights: finally added a command to toggle the lights in the ship
 - Always On Display: Added alwayson command that allows you to disable leaving the terminal screen on all the time or not.
 - lobby: As this was the oldest command in this mod I've updated it to be a bit more streamlined and pull from the same variable for both host/client.

 ### Fixed
 - TP/ITP: Fixed issue where you would be trying to buy either an inverse teleporter or a regular teleporter and these command would trigger instead.
 - (TP/ITP) You now won't be able to use these commands until you have a teleporter of the type required to run it.
 - From my own testing if everyone is using this mod the radar switch will be synced between players, so I've removed this as a known issue.
 - fcolor: Fixed the issue where this command would accept any color name instead of returning invalid for incorrect colors.


## [2.0.3]

 ### Added
 - fcolor: added command "fcolor list" to see what colors are available to choose from per request.
 - (fcolor) also added normal/default color keywords to set back to "normal" flashlight color (white)

 ### Fixed
 - switch: This base command was having weird interactions with all the different cams commands
 - (switch) Also a popular mod "FastSwitchPlayerViewInRadarMOD" was having some compatability issues with the new cams hooking logic
 - (switch) I've fixed all of these issues and hopefully this mod should remain compatible with any other mods that utilize the vanilla "ViewInsideShipCam 1" object name.
 - lever: Pretty sure I fixed having to pull the lever twice.
 - (lever) Turns out the reason for this was that the game requires a wait between changing levels (moons) and starting the game
 - fcolor: Reworked command so that it works without errors. As long as you have a flashlight in your inventory it will change the color.
 - (fcolor) If you have two flashlights on you it will only change the color for one. This is intended.
 

## [2.0.2]

 ### Fixed
 - heal/healme: Fixed typo in command causing heal function to not properly heal.
 - door: Fixed door command not opening the door for non-host players.

## [2.0.1] 

 ### Fixed
 - devtest: Removed my devtest command from active released patch. Luckily was linked to door command in 2.0.0 so no real damage could be done.
 - fcolor: Fixed missing null check handling case where player has never held a flashlight.
 - (fcolor) Also fixed flashlight colors not updating for your specific flashlight, was originally just looking for ANY flashlight.
 - config: Updated config description for enemyScanCost to actively reflect that it is for the "bioscan" command to avoid confusion.


## [2.0.0] 

### Added
 - MAJOR REWORK OF COMMAND HANDLING: Removed some convuluted logic in handling digits, added confirmation checks, and overall improved command to command interactions.
 - (MAJOR REWORK) This is the main reason for updating version number to 2.0.0, rather than calling this anything in 1.X.X
 - Terminal Menus: Updated start screen & help command with my own information.
 - (Terminal Menus) Added (more) command to see commands added from this mod
 - (Terminal Menus) (more) This will list 4 separate category commands to choose from (comfort) (extras) (controls) (fun)
 - (Terminal Menus) (comfort) Lists all the quality of life commands you have added.
 - (Terminal Menus) (extras) Lists all enabled commands that add extra functionality to the ship terminal. 
 - (Terminal Menus) (controls) Lists all enabled commands that give terminal more control of the ship's systems.
 - (Terminal Menus) (fun) Lists all the for-fun commands that are enabled.
 - (Terminal Menus) (comfort)(extras)(controls)(fun) All of these are also dynamic based on config options set.
 - (Terminal Menus) Added (home) command to go back to the start screen you see when first using the terminal.
 - Configurable Strings: Updated a majority of commands to have configurable strings.
 - (Configruable Strings) This will allow you to change the messages returned for most commands. Some commands will not have this feature implemented, some just haven't yet.
 - Gamble Update: Updated various elements of the gamble command
 - (gamble) Added a minimum credits requirement Config option. Set this to 0 if you want to be able to gamble it all!
 - (gamble) Added configurable Pity Mode. If enabled, this will give the biggest losers a configurable amount of "Pity Credits" (Max 60 to avoid abuse)
 - lever: Added a configuration variable for overriding new confirmation check.
 - lol: Added the option to configure a different folder to play videos from than the main plugin folder. (Credit to )
 - (lol) make sure when using your own folder it is in the Bepinex/Plugins folder.
 - itp: Added Inverse Teleport command to control the inverse teleporter from the terminal.
 - door: Added door command to control the Ship Doors from the terminal. 
 - (door) Credit to NavarroTech as I used their code for reference.
 - map: Added map keyword for "view monitor" command and removed the loadimageslowly setting so it shows instantly.
 - (map) I can add the loadimageslowly as a config option later if there is demand for it.
 - (map) Also should interface better with the other set of cams commands as of this patch.
 - proview: Added command that shows BOTH cams and radar map at the same time.
 - (proview) radarmap is put in the top right corner in a smaller box on top of the cams feed.
 - overlay: Added command that shows BOTH cams and radar map on top of eachother.
 - (overlay) Idea from @usb. on discord. Radar feed is superimposed onto the camera feed.
 - (proview/overlay) Both accomplish relatively the same thing. I may make these purchaseable upgrades in upcoming patches, for now they are only enable/disable in the config.
 - bioscan: Added a bioscanner that scans for biomatter (enemies).
 - (bioscan) Has a default configured cost of 15 credits per scan.
 - (bioscan) Can also be upgraded via bioscanpatch command.
 - bioscanpatch: Upgrades the default bioscan "software" to 2.0. Which gives more detailed information on biomatter (enemies that are alive)
 - (bioscanpatch) default configured cost of 300 credits, seemed fair to me but could use testing.
 - (bioscanpatch) Does not remove the cost requirement to run the bioscan command. I can add this option in future updates if requested enough.
 - (bioscanpatch) Like vitals, balancing is just abritralily set by me. Could use actual game testing to see what values are best.
 - vitalspatch: Purchasable Vitals Software patch that allows for vitals to be run anytime with no further cost.
 - (vitalspatch) You can configure the cost for this upgrade to whatever you want, 200 credits made sense to me.
 - (vitalspatch) If you have your original vitals command set to charge 0 credits this really doesn't need to be enabled.
 - fcolor: Added command to change flashlight color. Usage: fcolor <colorname>
 - (fcolor) there is a limited number of colors available. More can be added by request.
 - (fcolor) if requesting colors be added, please provide the rgb value of the color.
 - (fcolor) Current list of available colors: blue, cyan, green, lime, magenta, pink, purple, red, yellow, samstro, and sasstro.

 ### Changed
  - gamble: Now has a confirmation check so you can't blame me if you gamble it all away lol
  - lever: Now has a configuration check
  - heal: Updated heal logic to now say you were healed if you have less than 100 health but more than 10.

 ### Fixed
 - kick: Base game pushed out a hotfix for the kick function and I believe this has resolved any issues with the kick command in current mod.
 - (kick) will leave disabled by default as there doesn't seem to be too much demand for this feature anymore.
 - modlist: Config was not set up properly and this command was always enabled regardless of config option.

## [1.2.1] 
 ### Fixed
 - kick: Completely reworked command, was not kicking players and throwing errors in previous patch.  (only works in game version v40 and earlier)
 - (kick) Will accept as little as 3 characters of any name in the lobby and kick them now. 
 - (kick) May need to create another couple commands to kick via playerID# as players without english names are hard to kick through terminal.  
 - (kick) Also, I believe the current iteration of this command will not allow the player to join again until the lobby is remade. Requires testing. 

## [1.2.0] 
 ### Added
 - danger: checks Hazard level of moon once ship has landed.
 - vitals: checks health, weight, sanity, and flashlight charge of player being tracked by map radar.
 - vitals cost: configuration for how much credits the "vitals" command will cost to run.
 - tp/teleport: presses the teleport button from the terminal.
 - modlist: returns mods that were loaded by Bepinex and the associated version numbers.
 - kick (EXPERIMENTAL): allows the host to kick players from the lobby via terminal command. WARNING: This command is untested and therefore defaults to off at this time.
 
### Changed
 - lol: Made this command functional. Selects from an array of found videos in the plugin folder and plays a random video. 
 - (lol) You can type lol again to toggle the video off if you want to end it early. 
 - (lol) Video files should go in the "darmuh-darmuhsTerminalStuff" folder. 
 - (lol) Thanks to flipf17 for their work on TelevisionVideo, used their code for reference. 
 - Config: format has been changed, each command has it's own category now in case I want to add more variable specific commands like vitals' cost. 
 - Updated readme.md for better readability 
 
### Fixed
 - Fixed typo in lever command configuration values, thank you @glitched4772 on discord for reporting this.
